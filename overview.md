# High Impact Data Teams

The promise of data is highly seductive - organisations with their finger on the pulse, charting an evidence-based path to success and responsive to change.  
When this is achieved, it's amazing for all.  There are few (no) teams I've known that have completely delivered on every aspect of their potential.  Like any team, there's always opportunity for growth.  This work is an ongoing _work in progress_, a collection of information and a reference point to consider what makes a data team high-impact, what might we consider in our bid to determine what to focus on next?

The topic of _what makes an effective team_ is well studied, and I think relatively well understood at least in its generality.  There are some aspects of data teams that make them different from other teams, however.  The general applicability of specialty skills - as synthesisers of evidence, creators of data product, monitors of performance, guide strategy, shape the mindset of the rest of the business, and so much more - means that data can have a special role within an organisation, and are also subject to certain pitfalls.  These features warrant special consideration of _how_ a data team can be most impactful, and what is needed in order to achieve this.  Consequently, this work is nested within, and sometimes layered on top of, the extensive literature on effective teams. 

## What makes an effective team?
Google famously undertook work called Project Aristotle, which settled upon five team dynamics that are characteristic of highest performing teams.

**A word of warning:  What psychological safety is _not_**

The term psychological safety is almost unfortunate given the frequency with which it is misused.  
Edmondson describes psychological safety as _"felt permission for candour"_.  
What Psychological is not, however, is:
- an absence of candour
- lower standards
- avoidance of hard conversations.  
In fact, it is pretty much the opposite of each of these undersirable behaviours that evidence suggests will doom the performance of a team to the dim outskirts of it's real potential.

## What is a data team?

## What are the ingredients for an effective data team?

If we need to create the five dynamics of an effective team within the context of data, how do we do this?
What are the levers we can pull to create these dynamics, and how can we pull these levers most effectively?

To create these dynamics within a modern data team, I consider there are two broad sets of elements that data leadership needs to consider.  These elements are either: i) _internal_ to the team;  or ii) Context in which the team operates.  My hypothesis is that each of these elements needs to be nurtured and optimised in order for a team to be high-impact on an ongoing basis.

These elements are shown in the figure below.
